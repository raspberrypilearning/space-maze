## Permission to land

- If the Soyuz reaches Earth, then the `repeat until` loop will end.

- To finish off, you can add a little message to the end of the loop telling the player how long it took them to land on Earth. You can also stop the script. Use a `join` block to combine what you want to say with the count on the `timer`.

After the loop, you need to add some blocks that will do the following:
  1. Say the time on the timer
  1. Stop the script

Here's a jumble of blocks for you to sort out:
