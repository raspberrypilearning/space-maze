## Heading home

- The game needs to run until the Soyuz capsule reaches Earth, and the capsule should keep following the mouse position as the player guides it through the maze. Try and find the blocks you need to do the following:
  1. Keep looping until the capsule touches the Earth
  1. Point towards the mouse pointer
  1. Move 1 step

The loop you will need is the `repeat until` loop. You can find a block to detect if the capsule is touching the Earth in the `Sensing` menu.
