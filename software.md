# Software Installation

After updating your SD card to the latest build, you should also install the Chromium mods. This will enable the Flash player software.

To install the software you need, open a terminal window (press **Ctrl + Alt + t**), and run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y rpi-chromium-mods
```

If you see the message `rpi-chromim-mods is already the newest version`, you don't need to reboot your Raspberry Pi.  However, if it took some time installing the rpi-chromium-mods package, you will need to reboot your Raspberry Pi using the following command:

```bash
sudo reboot
```
